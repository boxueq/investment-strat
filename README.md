This simple web is a test using my 'Lur' Technique, inspired by Aristotles way of thinking.

Here's the format, 

Lūr(Aristotle) Technique:

Phase 1: Foundation (First Principles Thinking)

	•	Step 1.1: Identify the Basics
	•	Deconstruct the problem or concept into its most fundamental truths or elements. Ask: What are the undeniable facts? What is the core essence of this issue?

Phase 2: Construction (Logic)

	•	Step 2.1: Logical Deduction
	•	From the first principles, use deductive reasoning to form hypotheses or solutions. Each step of reasoning should be logically coherent.
	•	Step 2.2: Logical Verification
	•	Test these hypotheses or solutions for logical consistency. Identify and resolve any contradictions or logical fallacies.

Phase 3: Clarification (Feynman Technique)

	•	Step 3.1: Simplify and Explain
	•	Attempt to explain the concept or solution in the simplest terms imaginable. This can be done by teaching it to someone else or by explaining it to yourself as if you were teaching a novice.
	•	Step 3.2: Identify Gaps
	•	Note where your explanation falters or becomes complex. These are areas where understanding might be superficial or incomplete.
	•	Step 3.3: Revisit and Refine
	•	Return to the basics (Phase 1) and the logical structure (Phase 2) to fill in these gaps. This might involve:
	•	Relearning or researching further
	•	Adjusting your logical steps
	•	Step 3.4: Iteration
	•	Repeat the simplification and explanation process until the concept is clear and can be explained without resorting to jargon or complex ideas.

The Lūr Cycle:

	•	Feedback Loop: The process is cyclical. Each phase informs and refines the others. Insights from teaching (Phase 3) might lead you back to rethink the basics (Phase 1) or adjust your logical approach (Phase 2).
